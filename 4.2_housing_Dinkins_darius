```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(pastecs)

```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
